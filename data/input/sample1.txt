Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. The idea is to assign variable-length codes to input characters, lengths of the assigned codes are based on the frequencies of corresponding characters.

The most frequent character gets the smallest code and the least frequent character gets the largest code. This compression technique is widely used in file compression utilities and network protocols.

Example text with repeated patterns:
AAAAAAAAAA
BBBBBB
CCCC
DD
E

This sample demonstrates how Huffman encoding can effectively compress data by using shorter codes for more frequent characters. The compression ratio improves significantly when the input contains characters with highly varying frequencies.
